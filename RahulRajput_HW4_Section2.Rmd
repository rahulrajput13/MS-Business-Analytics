## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### ANSWER 1 ###

#PartF
sprintf("Using the RBD experiental design we find that except for Forms 1 and 2, all other forms are different whereas usiung the CRD experimental design we only found significant difference between Forms 1 and 4. This is because creating blocks allowed us to reduce the Standard Error and get clearer results.")

#PartG
sprintf("The SSE value in Q1 was 111480 compared to 5764 in Q2. The SSE in Q2 was lower as we reduced the error by introducing blocking.")
